Iozone is a filesystem benchmark tool. The benchmark generates and measures a variety of file operations.  Iozone has  been  ported
       to  many  machines and runs under many operating systems.  This document will cover the many different types of operations that are
       tested as well as coverage of all of the command line options.

       Iozone is useful for determining a broad filesystem analysis of a vendor's computer platform. The benchmark tests file I/O  perfor‚Äê
       mance for the following operations.

                 Read, write, re-read, re-write, read backwards, read strided, fread, fwrite, random read/write, pread/pwrite variants

-I     Use  DIRECT  IO  if possible for all file operations. Tells the filesystem that all operations to the file are to bypass the
              buffer cache and go directly to disk. (not available on all platforms)
